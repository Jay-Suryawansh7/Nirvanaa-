# 🚀 Nyaya Readiness – AI Case Readiness, Research & Mediation Dashboard  
### *Project for PKP Mumbai Hackathon 2025*  

## 📌 Problem Statement – PKPLG03  
**Delays in Justice System:**  
Case backlogs cause prolonged trials.  
**How can technology streamline case management, research, and dispute resolution?**



## ⭐ Overview  
India’s courts suffer from **4.5+ crore pending cases**, with nearly **50% adjourned daily** due to:
- Lawyer no-shows  
- Witness absence  
- Unprepared documentation  
- Missed mediation opportunities  

**Nyaya Readiness** is a judge-first platform that solves these problems using:
- A **real-time Case Readiness Engine**  
- A **lawyer confirmation workflow**  
- A **faster AI-aided research module**  
- A **smart mediation routing system**

This directly addresses all three components of **PKPLG03:**
**Case Management + Research + Dispute Resolution**.



## 🎯 Key Features (Hackathon MVP)

### ✅ 1. Case Readiness Score (0–100)  
Automated scoring based on:
- Lawyer confirmation (24h + 1h)
- Witness confirmation  
- Document readiness  
- Mediation willingness  

Status Codes:  
**READY, MEDIATION_READY, WAITING, PARTIALLY_READY, HIGH_RISK**



### ✅ 2. Judge Dashboard  
- View daily cases in one place  
- Color-coded readiness  
- Quick actions: Start Hearing / Notify Lawyer / Reschedule  
- Detailed case sidebar  
- AI suggestions (rule-based)



### ✅ 3. Lawyer Confirmation System  
Reduces no-shows using:
- Automatic SMS reminders  
- YES/NO response capture  
- No-show detection  
- Judge alerts in dashboard  
- Full audit log  



### ✅ 4. Mediation Module  
Accelerates dispute resolution:
- Detects MEDIATION_READY cases  
- One-click mediation initiation  
- Assign mediator  
- Schedule session  
- Track outcome (SETTLED / NOT_SETTLED)




### ✅ 5. Lawyer Accountability Metrics  
Tracks:
- Confirmation rate  
- No-show count  
- Avg response time  
- Badge: **CLEAR / WARNING / FLAGGED**  

Creates transparent reliability—*not punishment*.
